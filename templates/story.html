<div><h3>Our Story</h3><hr><h4>How we Met</h4><p>Kayla and Konstantin first met in their third year of medical school while on a Pediatrics rotation in December 2013. Well before it became clear that they would become a family, they were working as one, getting peed on, changing diapers, and feeding babies. In two short weeks, they began to realize that they did not only think the babies were cute, but also each other. Kayla ascertained the location of Konstantin's favorite study spot and soon would find herself "studying" there too. They then professed their like for each other on December 19th 2013, several hours before they would sit for their pediatric shelf. They have been dating ever since.</p><h4>The Proposal</h4><img src="images/ring.jpg" alt="Proposal" class="width100"></div>
