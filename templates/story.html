<div><h3>Our Story</h3><hr><h4>How we met</h4><p>Kayla and Konstantin first met in their third year of medical school while on a Pediatrics rotation in December 2013. Well before it became clear that they would become a family, they were working as one, getting peed on, changing diapers, and feeding babies. In two short weeks, they began to realize that they did not only think the babies were cute, but also each other. Kayla ascertained the location of Konstantin's favorite study spot and soon would find herself "studying" there too. They then professed their like for each other on December 19th 2013, several hours before they would sit for their pediatric shelf. They have been dating ever since.</p><h4>The Proposal</h4><img src="images/ring.jpg" alt="Proposal" class="width100"><p>On June 26, 2015, Kayla and Kostya's love reached a new level: Kostya asked Kayla to be his wife. With darkness and the distant views of the Verrazanoâ€“Narrows Bridge and the moon as their only companions, Kayla said yes and thus began their engagement period. When Kostya reflects on the night, he recalls the nervous excitement and adrenaline rush as he began to get down on one knee. Overrun with anxiety, he says that opening the ring box felt like eternity. When asked about the highlights of that night, Kayla remembered how happy the prospect of spending her life with such an amazing man made her feel and how appreciative she was of his preparation and delivery of the proposal. Like any mature couple already cohabitating, marriage was discussed prior to popping the question, But the actuality of the night still made the experience exhilarating.</p></div>
